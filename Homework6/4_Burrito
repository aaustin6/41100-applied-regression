#build data frame (maybe this is what i'm supposed to do first?)

#1- for forward regression from null to full
null <- lm(overall ~ 1, data=burrito)
full <- lm(overall ~ . + .^2, data=burrito)
fwd <- step(null, scope=formula(full),direction="forward", k=log(348))

#summary of the final model (best found model)
summary(lm(overall ~ Synergy + Meat + Fillings + Meat.filling + Sauce + 
     Uniformity + Beans + Temp + Cost + Meat:Fillings + Meat:Beans + 
     Fillings:Sauce, data=burrito))

#2- backwards step function (full to null) without interactions in full
nullb <- lm(overall ~ 1, data=burrito)
fullb <- lm(overall ~ ., data=burrito)
bkwd <- step(fullb, scope=formula(nullb),direction="backward", k=log(348))

#summary of the final model (best found model)
summary(lm(overall ~ Cost + Temp + Meat + Fillings + Meat.filling + Uniformity + 
             Synergy + Chicken + Shrimp + Beans, data=burrito))


#3- do same as in 1, but with new CSV 
clairemont<-read.csv("clairemont.csv")
nullc <- lm(overall ~ 1, data=clairemont)
#remove interactions or won't work for step function (too big)
fullc <- lm(overall ~ ., data=clairemont)
fwd <- step(nullc, scope=formula(fullc),direction="forward", k=log(36))
#for me it ends up with BIC=-INF the following error:
#warning: attempting model selection on an essentially perfect fit is nonsense
